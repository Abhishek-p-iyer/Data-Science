## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will be dealing with the exploratory data analysis for three types of ML models, 
i) Regression Models
ii) Classification Model 
iii) Unsupervised clustering models. 

## EDA Prior to Fitting a Regression Model
In [[EDA Prior to Fitting a Regression Model]] we focus on handling missing data and datatypes, checking for outliers, scaling data, checking for co-linearity between data. 

## EDA Prior to Fitting a Classification Model
[[EDA Prior to Fitting a Classification Model]], we focus on cleaning the missing data, pair plot analysis, heatmap analysis and finally PCA to get the most important features in our classification model.

## EDA Prior to Fitting a Clustering Mode
[[EDA Prior to Fitting a Clustering Model]], we focus on pairwise plot to see if there are any clear distinctions between the scatter plots, we also do look into the histograms that have a bimodal relationship. We then look into PCA, to zero down on a couple of features. We then use the visualizations to aid us better.
