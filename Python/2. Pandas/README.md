## Overview
- The [[Introduction to a DataFrame]] will work with the basics of manipulating single tables in pandas, creating a table from scratch, loading data from another file and selecting certain rows or columns of a table. 

- We will also look into [[Modifying a DataFrame]] where we add columns, use lambda functions and rename columns. 
[[Aggregates in Pandas]] goes in depth into different ways we can describe our dataframe. Common aggregate statistics include mean, median, and standard deviation. An important topic of pivoting a table is also discussed. 

- In order to store information efficiently, we spread data across multiple tables. [[Multiple Tables in Python]] will deal with merging, concatenating different tables.
