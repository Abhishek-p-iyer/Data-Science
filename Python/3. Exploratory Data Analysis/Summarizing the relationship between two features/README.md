# Summarizing relationship between two features
The bivariate statistics are used to summarize the relationship between two variables. Depending on the types of variables we want to summarize a relationship between, we should choose different summary statistics.

#### One Quantitative Variable and One Categorical Variable 
[[Quantitative and Categorical Variables]]:We can calculate the mean or median in this case, for example, if we want to calculate if manual cares or automatic cars cost more, we can calculate the mean or median for both of them are compare the values. 
#### Two Quantitative Variables 
[[Two Quantitative Variables]]:We can calculate the correlation between the two variables. For example, if we want to compare the cars price of the car over the years, we can calculate the correlation between year and price.
#### Two Categorical Variables
[[Two Categorical Variables]]: When we look into the relationship between two categorical variables, we can calculate the contingency table or we can use a chi-square statistic to determine the relationship between them.
