## Introduction to Data Wrangling and Tidying
[[Data Wrangling and Tidying]]
Frequently when we work with data, we encounter unstructured and/or _messy data_. Messy data can take a variety of forms. This could mean any of the following:

- The columns are mislabeled or do not have variable names.
- The dataset contains nonsensical data.
- Variables are stored in both the columns and rows.

While the data may be messy, it is still extremely informative. We need to clean, transform, and sometimes manipulate the data structure to gain any insights. This process is often called _data wrangling_ or _data munging_.

At the final stages of the data wrangling process, we will have a dataset that we can easily use for modeling purposes or for visualization purposes. This is a _tidy_ dataset where each column is a variable and each row is an observation.


## Introduction to Regular Expression 
The technology that fuels this verification system on nearly every website and application is the ever reliable, often quirky language of [[Regular Expression]]  or also called regex.  A _regular expression_ is a special sequence of characters that describe a pattern of text that should be found, or matched, in a string or document.

## Cleaning Data with Python
A huge part of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. Some have estimated that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it or building models from it.[[Cleaning Data with Python]]

## Handling Missing Data
Missing data means that there are potentially big gaps in the data and what we can learn from it. Since datasets often describe a population (either of subjects or events), [[Handling Missing Data]] will result in a better understanding of that population. From a statistical perspective, handling missing data means we will have better _statistical power_ (the ability to accept or reject a null hypothesis). Effectively, this means that we can be more confident that any findings from our data are accurate.
