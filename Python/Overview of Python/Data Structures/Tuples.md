Tuples is a type of data structure that lets us store multiple pieces of data inside it, the difference between a tuple and a list is that, lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable. 
- We can create a tuple by using `my_tuple = (<data1, data2, data3>)`
- We can access the tuples the same way we access lists
- We can use unpacking in tuples, to assign variables to the data stored inside of a tuple. Ex: `var1, var2, var3 = my_tuple`.  We can then access the data using the variable names
- To create a one element tuple, we need to create it using a trailing comma. `tuple = (<data1>,)`. We need to comma because the parenthesis is used as math operators, so to let python know we are creating a tuple, we add a trailing comma.
- We create tuples when we want to create data that is similar. The order of creating the tuple variables matters. We create tuples when we want the data to stay the same.
