# Data Visualizations

## Line charts in Python 
The [[Line Charts in Python]] module is the first step we take to get into visualizing data in Python. We will look into creating line charts, zooming into different parts of the graph, changing the appearance of the graph, adding labels and titles to the graph, adding legends and ticks. Finally we will look into saving the file.

## Beyond line charts 
The [[Beyond Line Charts]] module looks into the different charts we use to visualize data. We will compare categories of data with bar graphs, show uncertainty in data using error bars and shading, analyze frequency data using histogram and we will also look into pie chart.  

## Visualizing Categorical Data
[[Visualizing Categorical Data]] mainly involves using bar charts and pie charts. In this module, we will explore the use case, the pros and cons and modifying the charts for best communication. 

## Visualizing Time series Data
[[Visualization Time Series Data]] discuses on the graphs related to time series data such as the line plot, boxplots, lag plots, heatmaps, autocorrelation graphs.

## Data Visualization for Messy Data
[[Data Viz for messy data]] discuses about handling missing data, plotting outliers, limiting data points to find relationships, adding jitters in graphs and transforming graphs.
