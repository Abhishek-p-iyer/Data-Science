## Machine Learning 
Machine Learning is the process where the computer forms links between the data points and tries to make a prediction. There are two kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms 
1. [[Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn]]: It is a type of Machine Learning algorithms that use labeled data to learning and predict output. Ex: Credit Card fraud detection. They can be further grouped into:
	1. Regression 
	2. Classification
2. [[Unsupervised Learning with Scikit-Learn]]: A type of Machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples. Ex: Clustering. 

## Ensemble methods 
[[Ensemble learning]] is a process by which we build complex machine learning models by combining multiple weak base estimators as building blocks. The main goal is to build a machine learning algorithm that is robust.
