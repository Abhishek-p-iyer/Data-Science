# Supervised Machine Learning

One way of categorizing machine learning algorithms is by using the kind output they produce. In terms of output, two main types of machine learning models exist: those for regression and those for classification.
## Linear Regression
[[Linear Regression]] is a machine learning algorithm that tries to fit a line the best given two quantitative data such that the loss of each point is the minimum. 

## Multiple Linear Regression
In predicting the price of a home, one factor to consider is the size of the home. The relationship between those two variables, price and size, is important, but there are other variables that factor in to pricing a home: location, air quality, demographics, parking, and more. When making predictions for price, our _dependent variable_, we’ll want to use multiple _independent variables_ When we have multiple variables to consider, we perform [[Multiple Linear Regression]].

## Logistic Regression 
Where the Linear and Multiple regression models predict possible values for our dependent variables, the [[Logistic Regression]] model predicts the likelihood of an event happening. The model predicts a probability from 0 to 1 of an event happening. Ex: Predicting if an email is spam or not, predicting if a tumor is malignant of not. 

## K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier 
[[KNN Classifier]] is a classifier algorithm that classifies different data points into categories based on the similarities with its closest neighbor.

## K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
[[KNN Regressor]] is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can be used to predict a real number or quantitative values. We saw earlier that the KNN classifier is used to classify the points into groups, the regressor can predict a value based on its nearest neighbors. 
## Decision Trees
[[Decision Trees]] are machine learning models that try to find patterns in the features of data points. They use the information gain to split features into categories. 

## Support Vector Machines 
[[SVM]] is a powerful classification algorithm that uses decision boundaries to classify datapoints.  

## Naive Bayes Classifier
[[Naive Bayes Classifier]] is an ML algorithm that leverages Bayes' theorem to make predictions and classifications
