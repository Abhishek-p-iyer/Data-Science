## Fundamental Statistics

### Probability for Data Science 
In the [[Probability for Data Science]] module, we will focus on covering the fundamentals of probability which is useful to quantify the uncertainty and describe random events. 
We will focus quantifying uncertain events using certain rules like the addition rule, product rule, bayes theorem and tree diagrams. We will also learn how to describe random events, understanding the use-case for Binomial Distribution, poisson's distribution. 


### Introduction to probability distribution
The [[Probability Distribution]] module, will focus on the concepts of random variables, the mass and density functions and the cumulative distribution functions. Additionally, discuss Poisson distribution and binomial distribution along with expectation and variance. 

### Sampling Distribution 
In statistics, we often want to learn about a large population. Since collecting data for an entire population is often impossible, researchers may use a smaller sample of data to try to answer their questions. Over the course of the [[Sampling Distribution]], we will go over how we can extrapolate from sample data in order to describe our uncertainty about the statistics of the full population.

### Hypothesis Testing 
_[[Hypothesis Testing]]_Â is a framework for asking questions about a dataset and answering them with probabilistic statements. There are many different kinds of hypothesis tests that can be used to address different kinds of questions and data.

### Experimental Design
In the [[Experimental Design]] note, we will explore the sample size calculator necessary to perform an A/B Test.
